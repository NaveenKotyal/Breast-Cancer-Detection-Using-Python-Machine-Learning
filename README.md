# Breast-Cancer-Detection-Using-Python-Machine-Learning

This project focuses on utilizing machine learning techniques to detect and classify breast cancer. By leveraging a dataset of breast cancer features, the project employs various machine learning algorithms to build a predictive model. The goal is to aid in the early detection of breast cancer and contribute to the advancement of medical diagnostics.

Key Features:

Machine Learning Models: The project implements and compares multiple machine learning models, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees, and Random Forests, to classify breast cancer as malignant or benign based on features extracted from medical images.

Data Preprocessing: Comprehensive preprocessing techniques are applied to clean and prepare the dataset, including handling missing values, scaling features, and encoding categorical variables.

Evaluation Metrics: The project incorporates metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to assess the performance of the machine learning models in breast cancer detection.
